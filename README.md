ABOUT WIDES : 
The WiDeS group was founded in January 2009 by Andy Molisch, when he joined the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, after a career in both industry (AT&T Bell Labs, Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs), and academia (Lund University, Technical University Vienna). WiDeS is a part of the Communications Sciences Institute of the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC, and is affiliated with the ULTRA-Lab at USC.

WiDeS is dedicated to research that is both scientifically challenging and practically relevant. The main emphasis of our research is on the physical layer of wireless communications, but we also deal with overall wireless systems integration, networking, and cross-layer design. Our philosophy is to bridge the main chasms in today's wireless research.
